"Travelers often like to get a sense of how much fares cost when flying. The goal of this dashboard
 is to help users understand the cost of flying."

avg_lh_sh_fares()
"Here is a bar plot showing the costs of long and short haul flights over time. As expected,
long haul flights are on average more expensive than short haul flights, but this plot can help
the user begin to conceptualize how much more expensive long haul flights are to short haul flights."

prem_disc_by_year()
"Here is a bar plot showing the premium discounts of long and short haul flights over time. Usually they
range from 0-5% every year, but in 2017 there was a significant discount offered for both long and short 
haul flights. One factor that may have caused this were lower fuel costs that airlines experienced, which
allowed for airlines to add flights that otherwise would have been unprofitable, which in turn lower costs."

avg_fare_by_city()
"Here is an area plot showing the average fare for all flights departing from a city. The user can select
their city of choice using the dropdown menu and observe the trends in the average fare of flights from 
that city over time."

pct_by_avg_fare()
"Here is an area plot showing the percent of passengers flying long and short haul flight against the
average fare across all flights. The user can select for their year of interest with the dropdown menu
and observe the trends of people flying long and short haul flights."
