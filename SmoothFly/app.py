SmoothFly is a data-driven project that aims to help travelers avoid flight delays and cancellations, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. By analyzing data on airlines and routes, SmoothFly identifies the domestic US airlines with the highest likelihood of providing a smooth travel experience based on arrival/departure delay, denied boarding, and approximate travel fare.

In addition to providing analysis to individual travelers, SmoothFly builds a data pipeline that extracts raw data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and provides it to users in different file formats, enabling them to perform their own analysis.

With a focus on user experience, SmoothFly aims to alleviate the stress and uncertainty of air travel by providing actionable insights and data-driven recommendations.

    This website consists of 2 parts.
    1. A broad analysis on the airport scenario and quick insights
    2. The pipeline - You can select your Arrival airport, Departure airport, date range among other options to get the list of all direct flights from the departure to the arrival airport with the selected parameters. You can use this to conduct your own further analysis.

    We give you the option to work on multiple fire formats like Excel, CSV and SQL Database.

by the pandemic, this visual shows the percent of denied boarding between 2018 and 2021. Denied 
boarding most often happens when a flight has been overbooked, which explains why we see the lowest 
point of this plot in the summer of 2020. Due to the increase in travel restrictions and the spread of 
covid-19, it is likely that very few flights were fully booked, which would mean denials would be 
unnecessary. We see this percentage start to climb following the summer of 2021, and the percentage 
continues to increase through the end of 2021. Another important piece of information that can be 
gleaned from this graph, is that denials have been largely volunatry, meaning passengers have offered
to give up their seat on a flight in exchange for some form of compensation.""")
