SmoothFly is a data-driven project that aims to help travelers avoid flight delays and cancellations, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. By analyzing data on airlines and routes, SmoothFly identifies the domestic US airlines with the highest likelihood of providing a smooth travel experience based on arrival/departure delay, denied boarding, and approximate travel fare.

In addition to providing analysis to individual travelers, SmoothFly builds a data pipeline that extracts raw data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and provides it to users in different file formats, enabling them to perform their own analysis.

With a focus on user experience, SmoothFly aims to alleviate the stress and uncertainty of air travel by providing actionable insights and data-driven recommendations.

    This website consists of 2 parts.
    1. A broad analysis on the airport scenario and quick insights
    2. The pipeline - You can select your Arrival airport, Departure airport, date range among other options to get the list of all direct flights from the departure to the arrival airport with the selected parameters. You can use this to conduct your own further analysis.

    We give you the option to work on multiple fire formats like Excel, CSV and SQL Database.
