SmoothFly is a data-driven project that aims to help travelers avoid flight delays and cancellations, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. By analyzing data on airlines and routes, SmoothFly identifies the domestic US airlines with the highest likelihood of providing a smooth travel experience based on arrival/departure delay, denied boarding, and approximate travel fare.

In addition to providing analysis to individual travelers, SmoothFly builds a data pipeline that extracts raw data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and provides it to users in different file formats, enabling them to perform their own analysis.

With a focus on user experience, SmoothFly aims to alleviate the stress and uncertainty of air travel by providing actionable insights and data-driven recommendations.
